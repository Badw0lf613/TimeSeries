pyGPs is a Python library for Gaussian Process (GP) Regression and Classification.
Here is an online [documentation](https://www.cse.wustl.edu/~m.neumann/pyGPs_doc/), where you will find a comprehensive introduction to functionalities and demonstrations. You can also find the same doc locally in `/doc/build/html/index.html`. 

Generally speaking, pyGPs is an object-oriented GPs implementation. The functionality follows roughly the gpml matlab implementation by Carl Edward Rasmussen and Hannes Nickisch (Copyright (c) by Carl Edward Rasmussen and Hannes Nickisch, 2013-01-21). Standard GP regression and classification as well as FITC (sparse GPs) inference is implemented.

Further, pyGPs includes implementations of
- minimize.py implemented in python by Roland Memisevic 2008, following minimize.m which is copyright (C) 1999 - 2006, Carl Edward Rasmussen
- scg.py (Copyright (c) Ian T Nabney (1996-2001))
- brentmin.py (Copyright (c) by Hannes Nickisch 2010-01-10.)

Finally, pyGPs is constantly maintained. If you feel you have some relevant skills and are interested in contributing then please do get in touch. We appreciate any feedback.

Installing pyGPs
------------------
You can install via pip (**Recommended!**):
        
    pip install pyGPs 

Alternatively, download the archive and extract it to any local directory. 
Install the package using setup.py:

    python setup.py install

or add the local directory to your PYTHONPATH:

    export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/local/directory/../parent_folder_of_pyGPs

Requirements
--------------
- python 2.6 or 2.7 or *NEW:* python 3
- scipy (v0.13.0 or later), numpy, and matplotlib: open-source packages for scientific computing using the Python programming language.
