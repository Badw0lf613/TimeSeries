Demos
=========================
There are several demos exemplifying the use of pyGPs for various Gaussian process (:math:`GP`) tasks. 
We recommend to first go through *Basic GP Regression* which introduces the :math:`GP` regression model. 
Basic regression is the most intuitive and simplest learning task feasable with :math:`GPs`. 
The other demos will then provide a general insight into more advanced functionalities of the package. 
You will also find the implementation of the demos in the source_ folder under `pyGPs/Demo`_.

The Demos give some theoretical explanations. Further, it is useful to have a look at our documentation on `Kernels & Means`_ and `Optimizers`_.
