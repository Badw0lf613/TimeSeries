Graph Kernels
=========================
The code shown in this tutorial can be executed by running *pyGPs/Demo/demo_GraphKernel.py*

Load data
--------------------
MUTAG [1]_ is a data set of 188 mutagenic aromatic and heteroaromatic
nitro compounds labeled according to whether or not they have a mutagenic effect on the 
Gram-negative bacterium Salmonella typhimurium. MUTAG is a simple but popular dataset 
to benchmark graph kernels. ::

    data = np.load('MUTAG.npz')
    A = csc_matrix( (data['adj_data'], data['adj_indice'], \
        data['adj_indptr']), shape=data['adj_shape'])     # n x n adjancy array (sparse matrix)  
    gr_id = data['graph_ind']                             # n x 1 graph id array
    node_label = data['responses']                        # n x 1 node label array
    graph_label = data['labels']                          # N x 1 graph label array

Note that adjacency matrix for all graphs is usually too big to fit into memory when using :math:`GP`. 
Therefore, we generate :math:`A` using sparse matrix *csc_matrix* provided by *scipy*.


Compute propagation kernel matrix
----------------------------------------
Propagation kernels [2]_ are recently introduced fast and flexible graph kernels. 
Generate prapagation kernel based on given graph data. ::

    num_Iteration = 10
    w = 1e-4
    dist = 'tv'      # possible values: 'tv', 'hellinger'
    K = graphKernels.propagationKernel(A, node_label, gr_id, num_Iteration, w, dist, 'label_diffusion')  

Adjacency matrix :math:`A` can either be in format of standard numpy matrix or sparse matrix.


Standard GP Classification
----------------------------------------
:math:`K` is a big square matrix with all rows and columns of the number of data points.
By specifying the indice of training data and test data, we will form two matrix M1 and M2 with the exact format which *pyGPs.Core.cov.Pre* needed. ::

    M1,M2 = graphUtil.formKernelMatrix(Matrix, indice_train, indice_test)
    k = pyGPs.cov.Pre(M1,M2)

M1 is a matrix with shape **number of training points plus 1** by **number of test points** 
 - cross covariances matrix (train by test) 
 - last row is self covariances (diagonal of test by test)
M2 is a square matrix with **number of training points** for each dimension
 - training set covariance matrix (train by train)  

The following is the standard way to do GP classification ::

        model = pyGPs.GPC()
        model.setPrior(kernel=k)      
        model.getPosterior(x_train, y_train)
        model.predict(x_test)
