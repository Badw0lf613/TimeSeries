Basic Classification
=========================

The demo shown in this tutorial can be obtained by running *pyGPs/Demo/demo_GPC.py*.

Load data
--------------------
First, we import the data::

	# GPC target class are +1 and -1
	demoData = np.load('data_for_demo/classification_data.npz')
	x = demoData['x']            # training data
	y = demoData['y']            # training target
	z = demoData['xstar']        # test data

The :math:`120` data points were generated from two Gaussians with different means and covariances. One Gaussian is isotropic and contains 
:math:`2/3` of the data (blue), the other is highly correlated and contains :math:`1/3` of the points (red). 
Note, that the labels for the targets are specified to be :math:`\pm 1` (and not :math:`0/1`).

In the plot, we superimpose the data points with the posterior equi-probability contour lines for the probability of the second class
given complete information about the generating mechanism.

First example :math:`\rightarrow` state default values
----------------------------------------------------------------
Again, lets see the simplest use of gp classification at first ::

	model = pyGPs.gp.GPC()          # binary classification (default inference method: EP)
	model.getPosterior(x, y)        # fit default model (mean zero & rbf kernel) with data
	model.optimize(x, y)            # optimize hyperparamters (default optimizer: single run minimize)
	model.predict(z)                # predict test cases

Note, that inference is done via expectation propagation (EP) approximation by deault. How to set inference to Laplace approximation, see :ref:`more_on_GPC`.


Second example :math:`\rightarrow` GP classification 
------------------------------------------------------------
So we first state the model to be :math:`GP` classification now::

    model = pyGPs.GPC() 

The rest is similar to GPR::

	k = pyGPs.cov.RBFard(log_ell_list=[0.05,0.17], log_sigma=1.)
	model.setPrior(kernel=k) 

	model.setData(x, y)
	model.plotData_2d(x1,x2,t1,t2,p1,p2)

	model.getPosterior()
	model.optimize()
	model.predict(z, ys=np.ones((z.shape[0],1)))

**[Theory]**
In this example, we used an RBF kernel (squared exponential covariance function) with automatic relevance determination (ARD). This covariance function has one 
characteristic length-scale parameter for each dimension of the input space (here :math:`2` in total), and a signal magnitude parameter, resulting in  
a total of :math:`3` hyperparameters. ARD with separate length-scales for each input dimension is a very powerful tool to learn which 
inputs are important for the predictions: if length-scales are short, input dimensions are very important, and when they grow very large 
(compared to the spread of the data), the corresponding input dimensions will be mostly ignored. 


Note, *pyGPs.GPC().plot()* is a toy method for 2-d data::

	model.plot(x1,x2,t1,t2)

The contour plot for the predictive distribution is shown below. Note, that the predictive 
probability is fairly close to the probabilities of the generating process in regions of high data density. Note also, that as you move 
away from the data, the probability approaches :math:`1/3`, the overall class probability.

.. figure:: _images/d2_2.png
   :height: 600 px
   :width: 800 px
   :align: center
   :scale: 70 %

Examining the two ARD characteristic length-scale parameters after learning, you will find that they are fairly similar, reflecting the fact 
that for this data set, both input dimensions are important.

A bit more things you can do
----------------------------------------------------
GPC uses expectation propagation (EP)  inference and Error function likelihood by default, you can explictly change to other methods: ::
    
    model.useInference("Laplace")
