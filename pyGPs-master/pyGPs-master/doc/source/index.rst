pyGPs - A Package for Gaussian Processes
===========================================
About the package
---------------------
pyGPs is a library hosting Python implementations of Gaussian processes (GPs) for
machine learning.
pyGPs bridges the gap between systems designed primarily for users, who mainly
want to apply GPs and need basic machine learning routines for model training, evaluation, and 
visualiztion, and expressive systems for developers, who focus on extending the core
functionalities as covariance and likelihood functions, as well as inference techniques.


The software package is released under the BSD 2-Clause (FreeBSD) License.

Further, it includes implementations of

* minimize.py implemented in python by Roland Memisevic 2008, following minimize.m (Copyright (c) Carl Edward Rasmussen (1999-2006))

* scg.py (Copyright (c) Ian T Nabney (1996-2001))

* brentmin.py (Copyright (c) Hannes Nickisch 2010-01-10)

* FITC functionality (following matlab implementations under Copyright (c) by Ed Snelson, Carl Edward Rasmussen and Hannes Nickisch, 2011-11-02)

The most recent stable release is pyGPs v1.3.2. See :doc:`changelog <_static/changelog>` for a list of changes to the previous release. 
If you observe problems or bugs, please contact us. 
You can download the developer's guide and manual containing an API here: :download:`API and manual <_static/pyGPs_API.pdf>`. 
You can also download a `procedual implementation`_ of GP functionality from Github. However, the procedual version will not be supported in future.
